    detail: (1) Architected DrillingInfo's very first AWS cloud database offering (DIBI Cloud DB) which immediately resulted in 
                a significant increase in sales, increase in high-value client subscriptions/renewals, as well as a snowball effect of interest into
                the potential of  DrillingInfo's Cloud strategy and offerings after the first few months of release. 
            (2) Played pivotal role to backfill over 10 years of DrillingInfo production data (old school ETL files from the early 1980s) to satisfy a high value customer's request
                which had been distressing the organization for a couple of years due to the fact that it was a major requirement requsted by the customer
                for renewal.  Many failed, but I did it in 3 days.  The client renewed and I saved the company from potentially losing a >$2,000,000 
                contract...all because we couldn't get the data they wanted. ( 3 )
