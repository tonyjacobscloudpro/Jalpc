      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to our dessert-themed guide to setting up your CI/CD workflow using Azure DevOps Pipelines, GitHub Actions, and Infrastructure as Code. Just as creating a delectable dessert requires the perfect blend of flavors and precision, orchestrating your development process demands careful planning and sweet automation.
      </p>
      <div class="dessert-highlight">
        <h3>Sweet Tip</h3>
        <p>
          Treat your code like your favorite dessert recipe—measure each ingredient carefully, follow best practices, and don’t be afraid to add a pinch of innovation!

    <!-- Azure DevOps Pipelines Section -->
    <section>
      <h2>Azure DevOps Pipelines</h2>
      <p>
        Azure DevOps Pipelines automate your build, test, and deployment processes, ensuring that your software is always fresh and ready to serve. Think of it as a multi-layered cake where each layer—be it the base, the filling, or the icing—comes together to create a perfect dessert.
      </p>
      <div class="dessert-highlight">
        <h3>Recipe for Success</h3>
        <p>
          Configure your pipelines to include essential steps like code compilation, automated testing, and seamless deployment. A well-crafted pipeline ensures that every component integrates as smoothly as the layers of a delicious cake.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    
    <!-- GitHub Actions Section -->
    <section>
      <h2>GitHub Actions</h2>
      <p>
        GitHub Actions allow you to automate workflows directly within your GitHub repository. They're like the secret ingredient that elevates a good dessert into something extraordinary. With a vast marketplace of pre-built actions, you can customize your workflows to perfectly match your project's flavor.
      </p>
      <div class="dessert-highlight">
        <h3>Mix It Up</h3>
        <p>
          Combine various actions to create a workflow that caters to your unique needs. Just as you’d mix different flavors to craft a signature dessert, GitHub Actions let you blend tasks into a cohesive, automated process.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>
    
    <!-- Infrastructure as Code Section -->
    <section>
      <h2>Infrastructure as Code (IaC)</h2>
      <p>
        Infrastructure as Code enables you to manage and provision your infrastructure through code. Imagine it as the precise recipe that outlines every step and ingredient needed to bake your perfect dessert. With IaC, your infrastructure setup becomes repeatable, consistent, and as delightful as your favorite treat.
      </p>
      <div class="dessert-highlight">
        <h3>Bake with Precision</h3>
        <p>
          Use tools like ARM templates, Terraform, or Bicep to define your infrastructure. Store your IaC scripts under version control, ensuring you can recreate the same environment every time—just like following a trusted dessert recipe.
        </p>
