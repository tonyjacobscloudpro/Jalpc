### **2. Loading Data**
1. Prepare a local CSV file, e.g., `data.csv`.
2. Use the `PUT` command to upload the file to a Snowflake stage:
   ```bash
   PUT file://data.csv @~;
   ```
3. Load the data into a table:
   ```sql
   COPY INTO my_table FROM @~/data.csv FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV');
   ```

### **3. Exporting Data**
1. Query the data you want to export:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM my_table;
   ```
2. Save the results to a local file:
   ```bash
   !output format=csv
   !output file='output.csv'
   ```
