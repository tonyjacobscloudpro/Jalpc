## What Are Snowflake Shares?

Snowflake Shares are objects that enable secure, read-only access to data in a Snowflake account for other accounts. Shares do not require copying or moving data, ensuring efficiency and data consistency.

### **Key Features**
- **Zero Copy**: Shares do not duplicate data, reducing storage costs and ensuring real-time updates.
- **Granular Control**: Grant access to specific databases, schemas, tables, or views.
- **Secure Sharing**: Enforce role-based access control and encryption.
- **Cross-Account Sharing**: Share data with any Snowflake account globally.
- **Data Marketplace Integration**: Publish shares on Snowflake’s marketplace for broader distribution.

### **Components of a Share**
1. **Provider Account**: The account creating and sharing the data.
2. **Consumer Account**: The account accessing the shared data.
3. **Shared Objects**: Databases, schemas, or tables included in the share.
4. **Access Control**: Permissions defining what the consumer can access.

## How Do Snowflake Shares Work?

### **1. Creating a Share**
Define a share in the provider account to specify which data is shared.

#### **Example: Creating a Share**
```sql
CREATE SHARE sales_share;
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE sales_db TO SHARE sales_share;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA sales_db.public TO SHARE sales_share;
```

### **2. Adding Consumers to a Share**
Allow another Snowflake account to access the share by adding their account ID:

```sql
ALTER SHARE sales_share ADD ACCOUNTS = ('consumer_account_id');
```

### **3. Consuming a Share**
Consumers create a database from the share to access the shared data:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE shared_sales_db FROM SHARE provider_account.sales_share;
```

### **4. Managing Shares**
- **View Existing Shares**:
  ```sql
  SHOW SHARES;
  ```
- **Drop a Share**:
  ```sql
  DROP SHARE sales_share;
  ```

## When Should You Use Snowflake Shares?

### **1. Data Collaboration**
- **When**: Teams need to share data across departments or organizations securely.

### **2. Third-Party Data Distribution**
- **When**: Sharing live, real-time datasets with partners or customers.

### **3. Data Marketplace Publishing**
- **When**: Offering data products for monetization or broader consumption.

### **4. Reducing Data Duplication**
- **When**: Minimizing storage costs by sharing data instead of duplicating it.

### **5. Compliance and Auditing**
- **When**: Providing external auditors with access to regulated datasets.

## Best Practices for Snowflake Shares

1. **Secure Shared Data**:
   - Use role-based access control to restrict consumer access.

2. **Keep Shares Updated**:
   - Regularly review and update shares to include or exclude datasets as needed.

3. **Monitor Usage**:
   - Use `ACCOUNT_USAGE` and `SHARES` metadata to track share activity.

4. **Leverage Data Marketplace**:
   - Publish shares on Snowflake’s marketplace to reach a wider audience.

5. **Test Before Sharing**:
   - Validate data and permissions in a development environment before enabling access for consumers.
