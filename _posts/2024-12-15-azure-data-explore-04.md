## What is the Purview Data Catalog?

The Microsoft Purview Data Catalog is a centralized platform that allows users to search, classify, and manage metadata across various data sources. It empowers data discovery and governance by providing visibility into your data assets.

### **Key Features**
- **Search and Filter**: Locate metadata using natural language search and advanced filtering options.
- **Data Lineage Integration**: Understand the lineage of data assets directly from search results.
- **Custom Classifications**: Tag assets with business-specific classifications for easier searchability.

## Steps to Search Metadata in Purview

### 1. **Access the Purview Data Catalog**
- Navigate to your Purview account in the Azure portal and open the **Data Catalog** tab.
- Use the search bar to enter keywords related to the data asset you want to find.

### 2. **Use Search Syntax and Filters**
- **Search Syntax**:
  - Use exact phrases by enclosing terms in quotes, e.g., `"customer data"`.
  - Use logical operators like `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` for complex searches, e.g., `sales AND revenue`.
- **Filters**:
  - Apply filters to refine results, such as:
    - **Data Source** (e.g., Azure SQL Database, Data Lake).
    - **Asset Type** (e.g., table, file, pipeline).
    - **Classification** (e.g., sensitive data, PII).

### 3. **Explore Search Results**
- Click on a search result to view detailed metadata, including:
  - Data classifications.
  - Data lineage.
  - Linked business terms.
  - Owners and contacts for the asset.

## Best Practices for Metadata Search

### **1. Define Consistent Naming Conventions**
- Use standardized names for data assets to improve search accuracy.
- Include descriptive terms in asset names to make them easier to locate.

### **2. Use Custom Classifications**
- Tag assets with business-relevant classifications to enhance discoverability.
- Example: Add tags like "Financial Data" or "Customer Data" for commonly searched terms.

### **3. Leverage Search Filters**
- Use filters to narrow down results quickly.
- Save frequent searches using the **Save Search** feature for easier access.

### **4. Regularly Update Metadata**
- Ensure metadata is up-to-date to reflect changes in data sources or structures.
- Automate metadata ingestion using Purview connectors or APIs.

## Advanced Search Techniques

### **1. Search by Glossary Terms**
- Link data assets to business glossary terms and search using these terms for better context.

### **2. Search with Data Lineage**
- Use the lineage graph to identify related assets and dependencies.
- Example: Find all downstream reports impacted by changes to a source table.

### **3. Programmatic Search with APIs**
- Use the Purview REST API for automated metadata search.
- Example: Search metadata using Python:

```python
import requests

url = "https://<purview_account>.catalog.purview.azure.com/catalog/api/search/query"
headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <access_token>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}
search_query = {
    "keywords": "customer",
    "filter": {
        "and": [
            {"attributeName": "typeName", "operator": "eq", "attributeValue": "Table"},
            {"attributeName": "classification", "operator": "contains", "attributeValue": "PII"}
        ]
    }
}

response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=search_query)
print(response.json())
```

## Common Use Cases

### **1. Finding Sensitive Data**
- Search for assets classified as sensitive or containing PII.
- Use filters to identify relevant data sources or tables.

### **2. Data Lineage Analysis**
- Locate data assets with lineage graphs to analyze upstream and downstream impacts.

### **3. Data Discovery for Projects**
- Use metadata search to find datasets for specific projects or analytics use cases.
