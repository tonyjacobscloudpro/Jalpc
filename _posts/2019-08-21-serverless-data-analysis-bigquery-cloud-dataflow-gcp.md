Serverless Data Analysis allows organizations to carry out no-ops data warehousing using <b>BigQuery</b>, and pipeline processing using <b>Cloud Dataflow</b>. 

Google BigQuery is a petabyte scale data warehouse on Google Cloud that you interact primarily through <b>SQL</b>, and Cloud Dataflow is a data processing pipeline system that you can program against in either <b>Python</b> or <b>Java</b>. 

Serverless Data Analysis is meant for people who build data pipelines and data analytics. It is imperative that an individual working with these tools have a solid understanding of SQL, because of interactions with BigQuery, and know either Python or Java, to work with Dataflow.

<br />
<h3>
<b>What is BigQuery?</b><br />
</h3>
BigQuery is Google's no-ops solution to data warehousing and analytics systems, and by no-ops in this context essentially means that there is no infrastructure for you to manage, so no operations. It allows an individual to store data, analyze the data and export the data from a centralized location. 

<br />
<h3>
<b>BigQuery offers:</b><br />
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Interactive analysis of petabyte scale databases. </li>
  <li>Familiar, SQL 2011 query language and functions.</li>
  <li>Many ways to ingest, transform, load, export data to/from BigQuery.</li>
  <li>Nested and repeated fields, user-defined functions in JavaScript.</li>
  <li>Data storage is inexpensive; queries charged on amount of data processed.</li>
</ul>

<br />

<h3>
<b>Benefits of BigQuery:</b><br />
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>BigQuery separates out storage and compute. </li>
  <li>Near-real time analysis of massive datasets.</li>
  <li>No-ops; Pay for use.</li>
  <li>Durable (replicated), inexpensive storage.</li>
  <li>Immutable audit logs.</li>
  <li>Mashing up different datasets to derive insights.</li>
</ul>
