Serverless Data Analysis allows organizations to carry out no-ops data warehousing using <b>BigQuery</b>, and pipeline processing using <b>Cloud Dataflow</b>. 

You can download the Scala IDE for eclipse with the Scala Worksheet pre-installed from the following URL:

<a href="http://scala-ide.org/download/sdk.html">Download Scala IDE</a>

 (Make sure to download the IDE for Scala version 2.11.x!)

After downloading the archive for your operating system, simply unpack it and start eclipse. Eclipse requires you to select a workspace on startup. We recommend you create one workspace directory for this class and use it for all assignments.
