---

### **3. Performance Optimization and Tuning (20%)**
- Query optimization strategies:
  - Analyze query plans using `EXPLAIN`.
  - Monitor query performance via the Snowflake Web UI.
  - Configure virtual warehouses for auto-scaling and auto-suspension.
- Data optimization techniques:
  - Leverage clustering for improved query efficiency.
  - Compact small files to optimize storage and reduce I/O.

---

### **4. Security and Data Governance (15%)**
- Role-based access control (RBAC):
  - Assign roles, privileges, and access to users and objects.
- Data encryption:
  - Encryption at rest and in transit.
  - Key management via Snowflake's managed keys or customer-managed keys.
