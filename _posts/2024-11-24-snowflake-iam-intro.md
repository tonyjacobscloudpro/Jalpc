# Comprehensive Guide to Snowflake Identity and Access Management (IAM)

## Key Features of Snowflake IAM

Snowflake's IAM capabilities are built on three core pillars: **authentication**, **authorization**, and **auditing**. Let's explore these in detail:

### **1. Authentication: Ensuring Secure Access**
Authentication ensures that only verified users and services can access Snowflake. Snowflake supports multiple methods to suit different needs:

#### Supported Authentication Methods:
- **Username and Password:** Default authentication for user logins.
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** Adds an extra layer of security via apps like Google Authenticator or Okta.
- **OAuth:** Supports third-party providers for secure integration (e.g., Google, Okta, custom OAuth).
- **Key Pair Authentication:** Ideal for programmatic access (e.g., SnowSQL, Python connectors).
- **Federated Authentication:** Enables Single Sign-On (SSO) using SAML 2.0 with providers like Azure AD or Okta.
